# University_Attendance_Tracker

## Description:
A web app that helps you  as an instructor quickly register your student's attendance without using an Excel sheet, import Excel sheet to the database, export reports, providing functional requirements on students, courses, sections, and lectures that any university management system need

# Run University_Attendance_Tracker locally:

Please note that  it requires that you have node js installed on your pc, it is preferable to be version 14 or more 

if you don't you can install it from here  [node js](https://nodejs.org/en)

Create a folder to clone the repo on it then open the command window or git pash and cd to this folder

 1 . clone the repo: git clone (`https://github.com/nadasuhailAyesh12/University_Attendance_Tracker.git`)

  first running the  backend :

 2 . go to the repo folder in the folder that you clone the repo on it. At the root of the repo, there is a .env file, open it with Notepad and edit the user_name and password to your username and password in both URLs.

```
    example:  1.  DEVELOPMENT_URI=postgres://yourusername:yourpassword@localhost:5432/nadamohattendance
```

```
               2.  SEEDER_URI=postgres://yourusername:yourpassword@localhost:5432/postgres
```
2. save changes to it 

<!---->

âš¡warning: There  are two URLs: development and seeder so be sure to edit them both

3 . return back to your command window cd  University_Attendance_Tracker 

Run  `npm i` to ensure that all dependencies are installed this will take a couple of minutes.

note that the high severity vulnerability that will appear after finishing `npm i`it is not an error it is just because of the difference in versions

 4 .  Run `npm  run seeder` in the cmd,  **_ please: be sure that your de beaver is closed since dropping the database would make an error since another user is accessing the database so you can't drop it _**

5 . Run `npm run dev`  in the cmd, so the server is listing, please make sure not to close it off keep it open 

Second Running the frontend :ballot-box-with-check:

open another cmd cd  the repo that you have cloned then:

1 . `cd  client  `

  run  `npm i ` to ensure to install dependencies it will take a couple of minutes please wait till it finishes
  
2  . run  `npm start  `Happy hacking!

# ðŸ“ˆ Database Design:

We first collect the functional requirements, understand them deeply, then specify the entities at ERD , specify relations between them, and finally, output our ERD 

Our   entity relationship diagram :arrow-down:

## [ERD ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-jj47bS4wtTT9SrKN5q0XeCT0RWApCzX/view?usp=sharing)[](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-jj47bS4wtTT9SrKN5q0XeCT0RWApCzX/view?usp=sharing)

Then after that, we make reduction we reduce our ERD to a schema diagram,we use Normalization to ensure 

thar every relation is in good form 

this is our DDL create tables:

 of course, to ensure everything is working well you can try our queries on de Beaver or in your SQL shell and insure everything is correct here is our query sample
